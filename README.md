# Object Detection on road using DLL Algorithm

## Description

Object detection is a fascinating field in computer vision. It goes to a whole new level when weâ€™re dealing with video data. We can perform super useful high-value tasks such as surveillance, traffic management, fighting crime, etc. using object detection algorithms. 
Our objective is to capture the coordinates of the moving object and highlight that object in the video. Consider this frame from a video below:

We would want our model to detect the moving object in a video as illustrated in the image above. The moving car is detected and a bounding box is created surrounding the car. There are multiple techniques to solve this problem. You can train a deep learning model for object detection or you can pick a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on your data. However, we have used DLL algorithm for object detection and recognition.

## Results 

After running the code in the jupyter notebook and providing the sample video the following results have been obtained.
